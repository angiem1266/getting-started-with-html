    <h2>How the Web Works</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> consists of servers that store HTML documents that are broadcasted to the internet and shown in a web browser on a computer.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <b><em>HyperText Markup Language</em></b>.  HTML consists of the below:
    <p>
    - Text content (what you see)<br>
    - Markup (what it looks like)<br>
    - References to other documents<br>
    - Links to other pages</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>Tags & Elements</h2>
    <p>
      HTML documents consist of text documents which are built with elements that consist of tags and attributes. Some tags are considered <b>void tags</b>, meaning they have no end tags. Examples of this are <em>< img ></em> and <em>< br ></em>. Paragraph or <em>< p ></em> tags are not considered void as they need a closing tag of <em>< /p ></em> with the contents in between.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Not all Elements are the same. Some are <b>Inline</b> whereas others are <b>Block</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>      
      <b>Block Elements</b> have what can be called an <em>invisible</em> box around the tag which means they can be re-sized. They will start a new line when used. Some examples are <em>< div ></em> and <em>< form ></em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Inline Elements</b> are elements that do not show as a line break and are as is said in their name, are inline with the text. Some examples are <em>< span ></em> and <em>< strong ></em>.
